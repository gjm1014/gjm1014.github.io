        <div class="col-7 txt" style="font-size: 19px;">To tell the truth, I hope I could be an effective educator with full of responsibilities and appeals. .I am desired for the affection from my students, and the improvements of my students. We all know that the factors which evaluate weather we are excellent teachers are that if we can arouse the enthusiasm of students, and how much progress they will gain.<br>

 

          Actually, if you ask me ,the most significant elements which I am wishful for in our teaching career should be the abilities of solving complex problems, the teaching and learning strategies and the critical reflections.<br>
          
           And just as the e-book shows, Educational psychology will promote our specialized knowledge, and enhance our learning and teaching quality .Maybe that's why I have full of expectation to our EP subject.<br>
          
          There are 4 tools in the e-books to help us to become a more reflective practitioner:<br>
          
          1.reflecting on my teaching practice<br>
          
          2.developing my personal philosophy of learning and teaching<br>
          
          3.using existing research to inform my practice<br>
          
          4.conducing research of my own<br>
          
          I believe this 4 tools are the compulsory courses which can help us to have more progress space. What's more I hope I could gain an insight into what my students are thinking by observing their behavior in a group or individual ,and change my teaching strategies in time.<br>
          
           
          
          Last, I hope I could be open mind to listen our mentors critical friends and colleagues modestly . Because from the advise or criticisms I will get emotional and professional support for my teaching.<br>
          
           
          
          In fact ,I just contact the systematic learning about the education for a very short period of time ,so I could not use the tool like Research including reading and evaluating the data. I am green hands. But I believe that "practice makes perfect".<br>
          
          Unfortunately I am not a patient person, I need to be trained ability to give more time for my students to acquire my outputs. And also having deeply thinking about the reasons why they can't catch my words, and turn them into their own knowledge.</div>
